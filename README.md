# Stephania Nevado's Northfork Frontend case ✨

![][badge-ts] ![][badge-react] ![][badge-sc] ![][badge-jest]

Hello! This is my solution to the Northfork front-end "Todo app" case. It's built with TypeScript, React, and styled-components. I also added a few unit tests with jest and React testing-library.

The code is formatted with [Prettier](.prettierrc.json) and linted with [ESLint](.eslintrc.json).

## Improvements 💅🏻

Since I had limited time, everything in this app is of course not perfect. I have listed some improvements below that I would have liked to implement if I would have had more time.

- Add more functionalities like "edit a task".
- More unit tests - I only wrote a few to show how I would structure them.
- Improve UI/UX. I tried to make it pretty 💅 but I know that it's not perfect.
